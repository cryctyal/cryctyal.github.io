<h1 id="Contributing-guide"><a href="#Contributing-guide" class="headerlink" title="Contributing guide"></a>Contributing guide</h1><p>Want to contribute to Clipboard.js? Awesome!<br>There are many ways you can contribute, see below.</p>
<h2 id="Opening-issues"><a href="#Opening-issues" class="headerlink" title="Opening issues"></a>Opening issues</h2><p>Open an issue to report bugs or to propose new features.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reporting bugs: describe the bug as clearly as you can, including steps to reproduce, what happened and what you were expecting to happen. Also include browser version, OS and other related software’s (npm, Node.js, etc) versions when applicable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Proposing features: explain the proposed feature, what it should do, why it is useful, how users should use it. Give us as much info as possible so it will be easier to discuss, access and implement the proposed feature. When you’re unsure about a certain aspect of the feature, feel free to leave it open for others to discuss and find an appropriate solution.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Proposing-pull-requests"><a href="#Proposing-pull-requests" class="headerlink" title="Proposing pull requests"></a>Proposing pull requests</h2><p>Pull requests are very welcome. Note that if you are going to propose drastic changes, be sure to open an issue for discussion first, to make sure that your PR will be accepted before you spend effort coding it.</p>
<p>Fork the Clipboard.js repository, clone it locally and create a branch for your proposed bug fix or new feature. Avoid working directly on the master branch.</p>
<p>Implement your bug fix or feature, write tests to cover it and make sure all tests are passing (run a final <code>npm test</code> to make sure everything is correct). Then commit your changes, push your bug fix/feature branch to the origin (your forked repo) and open a pull request to the upstream (the repository you originally forked)’s master branch.</p>
<h2 id="Documentation"><a href="#Documentation" class="headerlink" title="Documentation"></a>Documentation</h2><p>Documentation is extremely important and takes a fair deal of time and effort to write and keep updated. Please submit any and all improvements you can make to the repository’s docs.</p>
<h2 id="Known-issues"><a href="#Known-issues" class="headerlink" title="Known issues"></a>Known issues</h2><p>If you’re using npm@3 you’ll probably face some issues related to peerDependencies.<br><a href="https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9204">https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/9204</a></p>
